  // This is the heart of the code, no pun intended.

  // and will move that emoji to that position.
  function moveEmoji(emoji, currentPosition){
    // setTimeout creates a delay, allowing the emoji to drop down in increments
    // instead of all at once.
    setTimeout(function(){ 
      // Set the Top Style property of the Emoji to a new value.
      
      // The Top Style property is how far from the top of the browser
      // the element should be located.

      // Changing it from 0, the top of the browser, to "5px", means
      // move the Emoji down 5px.
      emoji.style.top = currentPosition + "px";

      // For the next drop, we take the current position and add a random number from 
      // 0 to the height we want to drop it down by and set that as the next value of 
      // current position.
      currentPosition = currentPosition + Math.floor(Math.random() * dropDownHeight);

      // window.innerHeight means how big is the browser window. 
      // If the current position of the emoji is greater than the heigh of the window
      // it will appear off screen. So to correct that so it starts raining down again
      // we call the function reseting the value of currentPosition back to 0.
      if (currentPosition > window.innerHeight){

      // What's special about this function
      // is that before it ends, it then tells the browser to call the same function again.
      // What this causes is an infinite loop, also called recursion, where we call the
      // function once, it moves the emoji, and then it calls the function again. It'll
      // never stop moving the emojis.
      
      // Recursion is only one way to create loops in programming but it's a powerful
      // concept that is used for a variety of problems.

      // Even google knows about recursion. https://www.google.com/search?q=recursion&oq=recursion
      // Notice the joke, when you click "Did you mean recursion", you end up on the 
      // same page, allowing you to click "Did you mean recursion" again, 
      // which is a recursive loop.

                  // it delays the next call to moveEmoji.

  // how fast to rain down the screen, rainSpeed,
  // and how far to fall, dropDownHeight.

  // through them and animate them to rain down the screen.
